<h2> Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate</h2>
<p>The UK has four distinct seasons. Characterized by mild winters (2-7°C), cool summers (18-22°C), and frequent, often unpredictable, rain year-round. This is due to the Atlantic oceans influence.</p>
<h2>The Seasons: </h2>
<p>Winter (Dec-Feb): Cool, damp (2-7°C), with occasional snow in north/ Scotland.</p>
<p>Spring (Mar-May): Mild, often windy with showers (7-16°C).</p>
<p>Summer (Jun-Aug): Warm but can be unsettled (18-22°C), with longer days.</p>
<p>Autumn (Sep-Nov): Clear days, cool evenings (7-14°C). </p>
<h2>Influencing Factors:</h2>
Atlantic Ocean: Moderates temperatures, preventing extremes.
Gulf Stream: Further warms the islands.
Prevailing Winds: Bring moisture from the Atlantic.
